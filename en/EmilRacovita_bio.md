**Emil Gheorghe Racoviţă** (born Nov 15, 1868 in Iaşi, Romania, died Nov 19, 1947 in Cluj, Romania), was a Romanian biologist, Antarctic explorer, and founder of the science of biospeleology (life in caves) and of the first speleological research institute world-wide.

## Childhood

The Racoviţă family is an old Moldavian family, with origines documented from the XVI century. The family tree includes a number of high ranking figures, including principate rulers such as Mihai Racoviţă, who distinguished themselves as both nation builders and brave warriors. His Father, Gheorghe Racoviţă, nicknamed Gheorghieş, was a judge, and, as a founder of the "Junimea" society,  played an important role in the cultural and intellectual life in Iaşi, the capital of the Moldova Principate. His Mother, Eufrosina, nee Stamatopol, dedicated herself to the rearing of the only surviving child, Emil, from the three that the couple had. The other two, fell prematurely to illness.

Emil grew up in a warm and loving environment in the Şorăneşti mansion, a small village in the county of Vaslui, where the family owned land. In elementary school, he was a pupil of [Ion Creangă](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Creangă), from whom he inherited the gift of speaking using the soft moldovan language with unconventional terms and accent, style he used even in formal speeches at the Romanian Academy. He continued his schooling in Iaşi, first at the National Liceum and then in private at the "Institutele Unite", where he had as colleagues other romanian personalities: Sava Atanasiu, Grigore Antipa, Dimitrie Voinov şi Nicolae Leon. His teachers there were the historian Alexandru D. Xenopol, the chemist Petre Poni şi geologist Grigore Cobălcescu. The latter, inseminated the young Racoviţă with the passion for nature and thus played a crucial role in his future career choices.

## Graduate studies

Encouraged by his father to follow a legal career, Racoviţă left for Paris in 1886 and registered to study Law. However, his passion for natural sciences, made him attend the classes and presentations held by Dr. Léonce Manouvrier at the Superior School of Antropology. Soon after he received his license to practice law, Emil registered for the Faculty of Sciences at Sorbonne University, where he worked with to renowned zoologists: Prof. Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers and Asst. Prof. Georges Pruvot.

After his graduation in 1891, he remained in France to work on his doctoral dissertation at the
"Arago" Oceanographic Laboratory at Banyuls-sur-Mer, under the supervision of the same Lacaze-Duthiers. After five years of intense research, Racoviţă gets his doctoral degree based on the public defense of his dissertation on the cephalic lobe of anelide polichete -- the most common marine worms. This first success was the first step in an illustrious career.
