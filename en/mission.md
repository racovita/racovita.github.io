# Mission
{: .c4-section-title .border-start .border-2 .border-dark}


The mission of the foundation is to create an international collaboration network, called Racoviță Network, for cutting-edge research in nature conservation and environment. The Network will bring together researchers, explorers, and supporters to work on projects created on the scientific and ethics principles established by Emil G. Racoviță.

## Goals

<!-- The main goals of the foundation are: -->

1. Honor the scientific patrimony of the scientist Emil G. Racoviță.
2. Improve the international visibility of Racoviță's scientific work.
3. Enhance the international reach of Romanian science.
4. The integration of international treaties and conventions related to extreme environments where Romania is a partner, for example, the [Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)](https://council.science/events/2023-scar-sc-hass/) into research projects.

## Objectives

### Scientific Objectives

1. The organization of international events dedicated to the scientific accomplishments of Emil G. Racoviță, the Belgica expedition, research and exploration in the areas of speleology and biospeleology, oceanographic, polar and other extreme environments relevant to nature conservation, and evolutionism.
2. The organization of a recurring symposium on the research of extreme environments that brings together Romanian and international scientists.
3. Support and enablement of research in extreme environments and nature conservation through the organization of oceanic research expeditions in collaboration with international programs. Similarly, for other natural environments, such as caves.
4. Support for technological developments that enable extreme environments exploration.
5. Support for scientific education: classes, lectures, debates, camps, and summer schools.
6. Creation, editorialization and distribution of books, publications, posters, maps, software, and other informational material.
7. Connect the Romanian scientific research of extreme environments to the international elite through the creation of a collaboration network.
8. The enablement of explorations and research in the arctic zones through participation in the European Union programs or other international collaborations, for example [Svalbard Integrated Arctic Earth Observing System (SIOS)](https://sios-svalbard.org) and [European Union Plate Observing System (EPOS)](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/262229).

### Financial objectives

1. Provide access to resources to enable and support research in extreme environments; this may include the collection of ideas and suggestions from Romanian and international researchers to establish funding programs, government and EU funding, creating awareness in business and society circles toward nature conservation.
2. Sponsor grants for interdisciplinary research projects on extreme environments.
3. Facilitate the creation of collaborative research between Romanian scientists and international peers.
4. Create projects that directly contribute to the foundation endowment.
